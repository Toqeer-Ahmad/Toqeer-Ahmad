## About Me:<br />
AI was my passion and the reason behind doing a Master of Computer Science. However, I always kept myself away from coding even though my project was a "Macro Recorder" which I built single-handedly using C# during my Master's. In the present era stuff like Jupyter Notebook and Python, especially the frameworks and machine learning libraries have made the job very interesting. So I took some fundamentals courses to improve my Machine Learning/Data Science/AI skills. During this, I felt a spark inside for Machine Learning/Data Science/AI and felt "wow, I can do it". Machine Learning/Data Science/AI calls to my passion; it incorporates creativity, problem-solving, and the flexibility to break and improve the code.
